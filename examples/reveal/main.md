md2slides
=========

---

What do you want to do?
-----------------------

---

Build it!
---------

    md2slides -o /tmp/slides.html main.md

---

Don't you like it?
------------------

Then add some config:

    md2slides -c config.js -o /tmp/slide.html main.md

---

You can also serve it!
----------------------

With auto-reloading my friend:

    md2slides -d main.md
